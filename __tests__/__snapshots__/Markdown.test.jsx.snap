 npm-search allows you to search for and install
npm packages, all from the comfort of you
terminal.

 ## usage

 Just \`npm-search\` in your terminal, the app will
guide you through the rest

 ## TODOs

 1. ~allow users to search~
 1. ~Refactor routing to use less ternaries~
 1. ~add details view which allows users to read
package READMEs~
 1. infinite scroll for package search results
 1. allow users to install packages from within
the app using \`i\` from the details screen
 1. add instructions display as bottom line(tells
users which keys to push to use functionality)
 1. allow user to start a new search from any page
in the app.
 1. add command line argument support for \`-s\`
option. users should be able to do \`npm-search
-s=express\` to go directly to the search results
for \`express\`
 1. add command line argument support for the \`-p\`
